The best way to install Gypsum on OS X is to use Homebrew. Start by typing:
$ brew install pike
You may need to additionally install XQuartz, but the above command should
explain what needs to come next. Once Pike is installed, you should be able
to download Gypsum from this link, or clone the repository using git:
https://github.com/Rosuav/Gypsum/archive/master.zip
Using git is preferred, but either will work.
