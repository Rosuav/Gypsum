This file configures Gypsum's sound triggers. Note that this is deprecated, and in desperate need of rewriting.
An entry begins with its trigger text, preceded by a colon.
The next non-blank line is its audio file. Formats accepted depend on your SDL engine; most likely MP3, WAV, OGG, and MID will be supported.
If the file name is "-", no sound will be played. (Unix folk: No, I will not play a file from stdin.)
Subsequent line(s) specify flags/options. They can be combined onto one line or strung out in multiples.
Recognized options:
loop=N - number of times to loop; -1 for indefinite. Default: Play once.
stream=kwd - which stream to play on. The default stream is separate from all nameable streams.
noretrigger=1 - if set, this file will not be retriggered if it's already playing.
