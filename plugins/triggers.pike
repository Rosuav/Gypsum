//By popular request: Triggers.
//At its core, a trigger is a request that, when something comes from the
//server, an action be performed. That action could be to play a sound,
//set or clear some internal state (messing with anything Gypsum itself
//cares about would be unsupported, of course), send a string back to the
//server, or anything else.

//Stub to fill out later.
