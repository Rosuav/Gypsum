Monitors all input for long URLs, and offers to shorten them so they'll fit
on channels. Also saves all URLs received, and allows you to browse them
or copy them to the clipboard with the 'url' command. While Gypsum's core
makes URLs clickable, the keyboard may be more convenient, and thus both are
offered.

Thanks Thierran for helping me test the original RosMud version, of which
this is a port.

Currently uses TinyURL.com for the shortening.

NOTE: I've been seeing some issues with tinyurl.com lately (20150113), with new
URLs not working for half a minute or so. This plugin will be changing to another
shortener service, which would not fundamentally alter this plugin's purpose.
Currently accepting recommendations (goo.gl? bit.ly?). The plugin name will remain
as it is, albeit marginally orphanned; it's still plausibly descriptive.
