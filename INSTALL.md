Installing Gypsum
=================

Windows
-------
Download and run [this script](http://rosuav.github.io/Gypsum/get_gypsum.bat)
which should leave you with an icon on your desktop.

Mac OS
------
Installation on a Mac depends somewhat on your exact version of Mac OS. See the
[OSX installation instructions](README.OSX) for details.

Linux
-----

1. Install Pike and Git through your package manager (apt-get, yum, pacman,
   etc), choosing a "full" option if one is available. For example:
   `sudo apt-get install pike8.0-full git`
2. Run this: `git -C ~ clone https://github.com/Rosuav/Gypsum`
3. In the newly-created Gypsum directory should be a launcher. You can copy
   that to your desktop or panels etc.
