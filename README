Gypsum is a MUD/Telnet client written in Pike. It's built like a
server, but it's a client.

The main routine is in gypsum.pike; it loads all the other modules.
Needs a MUD server to connect to - I use Threshold RPG and Minstrel
Hall myself, but any will do.

You will need a Pike interpreter - see http://pike.lysator.liu.se/

Installation information and tips for Windows and for Mac OS X can be found in
README.WIN and README.OSX respectively. Installation on Linux depends on your
distribution; check your package manager for "pike" or see the above web site.

Gypsum follows Semantic Versioning v2.0.0; other than explicitly tagged
versions, the given version number will have the tag "-git". Versioning a
complex and multi-component project like this is nearly impossible, so the
number should be considered advisory at best. The version number for any
state should be marked in the file VERSION, as it exists in git.
