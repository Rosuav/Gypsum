Gypsum is a MUD/Telnet client written in Pike. It's built like a
server, but it's a client.

The main routine is in gypsum.pike; it loads all the other modules.
Needs a MUD server to connect to - I use Threshold RPG and Minstrel
Hall myself, but any will do.

This package also includes a stand-alone timezone converter. Once Gypsum is
installed, invoke timezone.pike to bring up a converter.

Installation information and tips for Windows and for Mac OS X can be found in
README.WIN and README.OSX respectively. Installation on Linux depends on your
distribution; search your package manager for "pike" or see the above web site.
Compiling Pike from source is best, if you're comfortable with that; Pike 8.1
has a number of improvements over Pike 7.8.

Updating can be done without disconnecting or restarting the program, via the
plugins menu.

Gypsum follows Semantic Versioning v2.0.0; other than explicitly tagged
versions, the given version number will have the tag "-git". Versioning a
complex and multi-component project like this is nearly impossible, so the
number should be considered advisory at best. The version number for any
tree should be marked in the file VERSION, as it exists in git.
