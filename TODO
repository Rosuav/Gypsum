* Generally, anything that people expect RosMud to do (should be pretty much done as of 20141223).
* OOCBox?
* Bug: Sometimes an attempted connection fails with no visible reason, and just hangs.
  - Seen 20140407; not seen again for a while 20140514. DNS issue maybe?? See also 77f192, may have solved it??
  - Still haven't seen it again 20140718, quite probably is solved.
  - Hmm, might this be connected (huh huh) to Pike b1f196 / bug 7293?
  - Better than trying to pin this down might be to just ensure that there's a timeout on connection attempts.
* Some kind of system for suppressing statusbar entries without each plugin having to do it.
  Maybe a multiset of plugin IDs (basenames) which should have their primary statusbar frames
  hidden instead of visible?
* There's some sort of resource leakage that results in slow-downs. Possibly to do with updating window.
  - Seen 20140820; not seen again for a while 20141204.
* Generalized way for plugins to be configured?? Only loaded plugins can be configured, so it may be awkward.
  - Would require some kind of registration with the system, so this will need the proper enhancement protocol.
  - Ideally, this should be part of Plugins|Configure... somehow. Maybe it can steal a little room from the
    docstring section? A couple of constants (label and persist key) could cover it.
  - See notes in edit.pike too.
  - If part of Plugins|Configure, this needs to be equally able to configure active and inactive plugins.
  - Mostly done, test and document me.
* Mark-and-copy of RTL text has some issues. May be v difficult (even impossible) to fully solve, but try to make
  it behave at least reasonably well most of the time.
* Mac support: can I put together a Homebrew recipe for Gypsum, which will pull in Pike?

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Search the code for "7.8" and see what's commented
4) Unconditionally connect to the paste_clipboard signal in window.pike
Note that Pike 8.1 has been cut, and 8.0 declared to be the new stable, so this should be possible soon, Aslan-style.

There are a few places around the code where magic happens. Ideally they should
become less magical... but for now, their documentation here will give them at
least some chance of being found.
* Creating timers (plugins/timer.pike) with names " HP", " SP", and ".EP" will handle them with Threshold RPG semantics.
* Creating a world (plugins/connect.pike) with an IP address of "0.0.0.0" or "::" will put it in passive mode (IPv4 or IPv6).
Note that Help|Tips / plugins/tips.pike may be able to make things less obscure, but do not depend on this.

Vague theories of maybe-this-would-be-nice:
* Boss key (would require support from Pike - Lin/Win/Mac = three separate techniques, all hard)
  - though this might be possible as a separately-runnable executable, which communicates with
  - the main process via a pipe whose name is stored in persist[], and signals it; this could be
  - then given two keystrokes in an OS-dependent way (one for hide, one for unhide).
  - Note that pipe creation is itself OS-dependent, so this may end up working with completely
  - different code on each OS. :( Alternatively, this could be done with a TCP socket, but that
  - seems a smidge like overkill, especially as it'll trip software firewall alarms. :(
  - This would have to be done as a non-default plugin, for safety.
  - How does VLC do global hotkeys? Can I tie in with the same facilities? Is it cross-platform?
    (At very least, VLC can do it on Windows and Linux. Presumably Mac OS as well.)
* 256 color support
* Negotiation/detection of Unicode/UTF-8 support? Figure out how servers go about detecting.
