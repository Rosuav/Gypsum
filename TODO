* Generally, anything that people expect RosMud to do (should be pretty much done as of 20141223).
* OOCBox?
* Bug: Sometimes an attempted connection fails with no visible reason, and just hangs.
  - Seen 20140407; not seen again for a while 20140514. DNS issue maybe?? See also 77f192, may have solved it??
  - Still haven't seen it again 20140718, quite probably is solved.
  - Hmm, might this be connected (huh huh) to Pike b1f196 / bug 7293?
  - Better than trying to pin this down might be to just ensure that there's a timeout on connection attempts.
  - CJA 20150704: I suspect this has something to do with DNS issues, which would mean it's changed as of 1500b9. Test me.
* There's some sort of resource leakage that results in slow-downs. See comments in window.pike in paint().
* Mark-and-copy of RTL text has some issues. May be v difficult (even impossible) to fully solve, but try to make
  it behave at least reasonably well most of the time.
* Mac support: can I put together a Homebrew recipe for Gypsum, which will pull in Pike?
* Demo/doco plugin that inherits everything and shows off what's happening? A simple say() in every hook function
  and a "hello world" of every other type would be a reasonable way to demo everything.
* Support/acknowledge /etc/nsswitch.conf?? Or at least parse /etc/hosts, which is more cross-platform.

Eventually, drop support for Pike 7.8. This means:
1) Feel free to use new features like ->?
2) Drop COMPAT_SIGNAL and possibly other COMPAT features
3) Search the code for "7.8" and see what's commented
4) Unconditionally connect to the paste_clipboard signal in window.pike
Note that Pike 8.1 has been cut, and 8.0 declared to be the new stable, so this should be possible soon, Aslan-style.

There are a few places around the code where magic happens. Ideally they should
become less magical... but for now, their documentation here will give them at
least some chance of being found.
* Creating timers (plugins/timer.pike) with names " HP", " SP", and ".EP" will handle them with Threshold RPG semantics.
* Creating a world (plugins/connect.pike) with an IP address of "0.0.0.0" or "::" will put it in passive mode (IPv4 or IPv6).
Note that Help|Tips (plugins/tips.pike) may be able to make things less obscure, but do not depend on this.

Vague theories of maybe-this-would-be-nice:
* Boss key (would require support from Pike - Lin/Win/Mac = three separate techniques, all hard)
  - Though this might be possible as a separately-runnable executable, which communicates with
    the main process via a pipe whose name is stored in persist[], and signals it; this could be
    then given two keystrokes in an OS-dependent way (one for hide, one for unhide).
  - Note that pipe creation is itself OS-dependent, so this may end up working with completely
    different code on each OS. :( Alternatively, this could be done with a TCP socket, but that
    seems a smidge like overkill, especially as it'll trip software firewall alarms. :(
  - This would have to be done as a non-default plugin, for safety.
  - VLC can do hotkeys on multiple different platforms, and may be a plausible imitation target.
    - After investigation, turns out, no help. VLC has a dedicated thread on win32 doing the exact
      same thing as I was doing in RosMud (RegisterHotKey and so on), and using xcb_grab_key for
      X11 platforms. So, unless I do it up as a C module for Pike, this is not going to work. And
      importing C into arbitrary Pike installations ain't gonna happen. :(
* 256 color support
* Negotiation/detection of Unicode/UTF-8 support? Figure out how servers go about detecting. Need
  to find at least one server that detects, before that can make sense.
* Lumina reported a strange issue whereby the input field was either black-on-black, or just not drawing. May be
  a font renderer or video driver issue. Windows 7. If ever seen elsewhere, look into. (Lumina also had issues
  with the charsheet plugin, which were quite probably the same problem remanifesting.)
